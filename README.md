# DeFi Arbitrage Bot

A sophisticated Node.js-based arbitrage bot designed to identify and capitalize on price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges using flash loans, eliminating the need for substantial upfront capital.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flash Loan Integration**: Leverages flash loans to execute arbitrage without requiring significant capital upfront
- **Real-Time Opportunity Detection**: Continuously monitors DEXs for profitable price discrepancies
- **Gas-Aware Execution**: Factors gas costs into profit calculations to ensure genuine profitability
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns for easy maintenance and extension
- **Risk Management**: Implements protective measures to safeguard operations during volatile market conditions
- **Event-Based Monitoring**: Listens to blockchain events to capture time-sensitive opportunities

## 🏗️ Architecture

The bot operates through a sequence of specialized modules:

1. **OrbitOrchestrator**: Central coordination system that manages the entire workflow
2. **PricePulseNexus**: Aggregates real-time price data from various DEXs
3. **OpportunityScanner**: Analyzes markets to identify potential arbitrage opportunities
4. **GasGuardOptimizer**: Calculates and optimizes transaction gas costs
5. **RiskShieldSentinel**: Evaluates and manages trading risks
6. **TradeWaveExecutor**: Executes trades by interacting with smart contracts and flash loan providers
7. **ChronoLoggerVault**: Handles logging and transaction history for analysis

## 🔄 Working Mechanism

1. **Data Collection**: The system fetches real-time data from Ethereum-based DEXs through blockchain interactions
2. **Event Monitoring**: Continuously listens to relevant DEX events to capture trading opportunities as they emerge
3. **Opportunity Analysis**: Calculates potential arbitrage profits based on current market conditions
4. **Gas Optimization**: Factors in current gas prices to ensure profitability after transaction costs
5. **Feasibility Check**: Determines if an opportunity remains profitable after accounting for all expenses
6. **Trade Execution**: If profitable, initiates flash loans and executes trades across multiple DEXs

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- Ethereum wallet with private key access
- Basic understanding of DeFi concepts and flash loans

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirja123/defi-arbitrage-bot.git
   cd defi-arbitrage-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create and configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your:
   - Ethereum wallet private key
   - Infura/Alchemy API key
   - Flash loan provider details
   - Target DEX addresses
   - Risk parameters

### Configuration

Configure the bot's behavior by modifying files in the `configs/` directory:
- `ethereum.json`: Ethereum network settings
- `config.json`: General bot configuration

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Monitoring

The bot includes built-in logging to track its operation. You can also use the included monitoring script:

```bash
./scripts/monitorBot.sh
```

## ⚠️ Risk Management

The `RiskShieldSentinel` module implements several risk management strategies:

- **Slippage Protection**: Aborts transactions if slippage exceeds configured thresholds
- **Maximum Position Size**: Limits the size of individual arbitrage opportunities
- **Network Congestion Detection**: Pauses operations during periods of extreme gas prices
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatically halts trading during abnormal market conditions

## 🔍 Performance Metrics

Monitor your bot's performance through:

- **Profit/Loss Tracking**: Total and per-trade profit metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully executed arbitrage opportunities
- **Gas Efficiency**: Average gas costs as a percentage of profit
- **Opportunity Identification Rate**: Number of potential opportunities identified versus executed

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Private Key Management**: Never expose your private keys; use environment variables
- **Contract Auditing**: Verify all smart contracts you interact with are audited and secure
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement reasonable rate limits to avoid API bans
- **Gas Price Protection**: Set maximum gas price limits to prevent excessive costs

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Multi-chain support (Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.)
- Centralized Exchange integration
- Advanced trading strategies beyond simple arbitrage
- Machine learning for opportunity prediction
- User-friendly dashboard
